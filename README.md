# Description
Short story of creation of Alarm Continue.
I wanted to solve: How not to hate the songs that i put on for my alarm. The solution had 4 options.
1. Select some of your favourite music and then every time the alarm triggers a song will be randomly choosen, so you never know which one is next.
2. Don't play the music from the beggining every single time. Just continue from the moment it stopped.
3. Combine both 1. and 2.
4. Or just put the phone on vibrate, no music, no sound ðŸ˜”

That is how this app was created after months of work.
For everyday I added BEDTIME which is a one of the main features. Why? Because we humans don't have a pause button. If you want to get consistent sleep and wake up rested, just stick to a routine. Go to bed at 22:30, so you fell asleep till 23:00 and then get 8 hours of sleep and wake up rested at 7:00 and NO SNOOZING (I don't support snoozing)

All Features:

âœ” Resume the song from the moment it previosly ended

âœ” Every alarm are slowly increasing the volume and vibration

âœ” Set alarms for specific days

âœ” Built-in Bedtime - setup your wake and bedtime for CONSISTENT sleep.

âœ” Upcoming bedtime notification

âœ” Random song from your selection for that alarm

âœ” Alarm doesn't stop until swiped down

âœ” Custom animations that are randomly choosen when the alarm or bedtime goes off

âœ” ALL alarms will slowly start. First with vibrations and then will go louder and louder.

âœ” Totally FREE and NO ads what so ever. So it is AD-FREE.


Animations are all made in Lottie:
